SolarBoost is an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes the sun's position and solar energy production potential based on location, date, and time.

---

## üåü Features
- Calculate the sun's position (azimuth and elevation) based on date, time, and location  
- Visualize sun position with an interactive polar plot  
- Get accurate sunrise and sunset times for any location  
- Estimate solar energy production for your solar panels  
- Plan optimal solar panel placement with real-time data
